## Getting Started

The Typing Speed Test is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to help users measure their typing speed and accuracy. It provides a random set of words for users to type as quickly and accurately as possible within a specified time frame.

## Key Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The application fetches a set of random words from an online source to keep the test unbiased and challenging.

- **Typing Speed Measurement**: Users can type the provided words, and the application calculates and displays their typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

- **Accuracy Assessment**: The application also checks for typing mistakes and provides information about the accuracy of the user's typing.

- **Time Limit**: The test is time-limited to 60 seconds, after which the typing is evaluated.

- **Restart Option**: Users can restart the test to attempt it again.

## Usage

1. Run the typing_speed_test.py script to start the application.
2. The provided words are displayed on the screen, and the timer starts.
3. Type the words as quickly and accurately as possible within the 60-second time frame.
4. Once the time is up, the application displays your typing speed and accuracy.
